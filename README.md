## PROJECTS  

### 1. House Sales Price Prediction in King County, USA  
- Applied data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict house prices using the King County House Sales dataset.  
- Cleaned data by handling missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and filled missing values in bedrooms and bathrooms.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand correlations between house prices and features like square footage, waterfront views, and home condition.  
- Developed models using Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Ridge Regression to predict house prices.  
- Evaluated models using R² scores and cross-validation, optimizing predictions with Ridge regularization.  

**Skills & Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression  
**Project Link:** [Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/nabihanasir/House-Sales-Analysis)
